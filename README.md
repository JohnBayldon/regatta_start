simple code for running a sailing regatta start sequnece using arduino or equivalent

this code has been tested on teensy LC and arduino uno.
its still pretty basic connect the horn relay to the HORN_PIN and a piezo beeper to the BEEPER_PIN.
right now its controlled by sending messages over bluetooth using an HC-06
